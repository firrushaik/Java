# converting decimol number to binary number:

To convert a decimal number to binary, repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and note the remainders. The binary number is the sequence of these remainders read in reverse order—from last to first.

Step-by-step process:

Divide the decimal number by 2.

Record the remainder (0 or 1). This is your least significant bit (LSB).

Update the quotient: Divide the result (quotient) from the previous step by 2 again.

Repeat steps 2-3 until the quotient is 0.

Write out the remainders from last to first (reverse order). This sequence forms the binary number.

Example: Convert 13 to binary

13 ÷ 2 = 6, remainder 1

6 ÷ 2 = 3, remainder 0

3 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 1

1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1

Write remainders in reverse: 1101
So, 13 in decimal equals 1101 in binary.
