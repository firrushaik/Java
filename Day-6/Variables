Variables are containers used to store the data. variables are also called Identifiers.

// Declaring a variables 
// When we declare a variable the Java Virtual Machine allocates a specific amount of memory for that variable
Datatype VariableName;
example : int age;

// Initialization a variable 
// Variable initilization is the process of assigning an initial value to a variable in a computer program
// When we initilize a variable , it will assign the some value to that variable
VariableName = Value;
example : age = 20;

// Declaring and Initializing a variable 
Datatype VariableName = Value;
example : int age = 20;
string name = "Banu"

A variable is must be declared before it can be initilized.

// we can't declare two variables with same name
for example : int age = 20;
int age = 30;
int age = 50;

// But we can declare two variables with different name
for example : int a = 20;
int b = 30;

// We can initialize multiple variables to the same variable 
for example : age = 20;
age = 30;
age = 50;
