Data type : Data types refers to the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable.

Data type refers to the which type of data or value to be stored in the variable . 
According to that data type it will allocate the size of the memory in the stack area. 

There are 2 types of data types in java :

Primitive data type 
Non primitive data type

Primitive data type : These are the most basic data types, directly storing the values in the memory.
They are pre defined by the language and not objects.
In java , 8 primitive data types:

byte: 8-bit signed integer.
short: 16-bit signed integer.
int: 32-bit signed integer (most commonly used for whole numbers).
long: 64-bit signed integer.
float: 32-bit single-precision floating-point number.
double: 64-bit double-precision floating-point number (most commonly used for decimal numbers).
char: 16-bit Unicode character.
boolean: Stores true or false values.  


Non primitive data types : These datthe actual data a types do not directly store the data but store references(memory addresses) to objects that hold the actual data in heap memory.
