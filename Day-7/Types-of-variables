In Java programming language , variables are three types .
         Local variable
         Static variable 
         Instance variables

Local variables : Local variables are declared within a method or block .
Access modifiers cannot be used for local varisbles.

Static variable : Class varisbles are also called as static varisbles. Static variables are declared with the static keyword within a class but outside the method or block.

Instance variables : A variable is declared within a class but outside the method or block .
Access modifier can be given for instance variables .
Instance variables are created when an object of the class is created with the use of the keyword 'new' and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
