# generations of programming language 
       There are five generations of programming languages. they are listed below:
First-generation languages

Second-generation languages

Third-generation languages

Fourth-generation languages

Fifth-generation languages 

Now we will discuss about step-by-step generation :

# First-generation-language :

First generation languages is also known as machine languages, are the simplest type of computer language. 

The main electronic component used in the computers of the 1940s and 1950s era were "vacuum tubes", which were used for both circuitry and memory storage.

To interface directly with a computer hardware, these languages use binary code, which consists of 0s and 1s.

The size used to be very large which could take up entire rooms and the speed was very slow.

# Second-generation-language :

Second generation languages is  also known as " assembly languages " , introduced human readable notations , such as mnemonics, that are easier to understand than binary code.

The main electronic component used in the computers of the 1950s and 1960s era were " transistors ".

The main memory storing units were  magnetic tape or disk and magnetic core.

There was an improvement in speed.

The size is smaller than first generation computers and they used to low power and generate less heat.

# Third-generation-language :

Third generation languages also known as "procedural languages ".

It is a high level programming languages designed to be more user-friendly by utilizing syntax similar to human language.

The main electronic components used in the computers of the era 1960s to 1970s were " integrated circuits ICS " .

The memory storing units were the magnetic disk or take and a large magnetic core .

High level languages such as BASIC,COBOL,PASCAL were used as the programming language.

For execution , a program in this language needs to be translated into machine language using a compiler/interpreter.

The size were  smaller and efficient and the computers were called minicomputers.

# Fourth-generation-language : 

The fourth generation  language is also called as non-procedural language/4GL.

The fourth generation languages are created to simplify programming by using syntax that is more similar to everyday human language. 

These languages allow users to focus on specifying what tasks need to be done,without needing to worry about the specific implementation details.

# Fifth-generation-language :

The main electronic components that are used in the present generation of computers is Artificial intelligence which uses the parallel processing method and the ultra-large scale integration.

The fifth generation of computers understands the natural human language.

These computers are portable and have a huge storage capacity.

eg: laptops,desktops,tablets,smartphones etc.
