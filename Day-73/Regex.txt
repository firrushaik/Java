Regex: 
   Regex stands for Regular Expressions.

Regular Expressions (Regex) in Java:

Regular Expressions, or Regex, are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In Java, regex is implemented using the java.util.regex package, which provides two main classes: Pattern and Matcher.

Key Components of Regex in Java:

1) Pattern Class: Defines a compiled representation of a regex.
2) Matcher Class: Performs operations like matching, searching, and replacing on text using a Pattern(out input).

Common Regex Patterns:


\d	Matches any digit (0-9).
\w	Matches any word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _).
\s	Matches any whitespace character.
^	Matches the start of a string.
$	Matches the end of a string.
.*	Matches zero or more of any character.
[abc]	Matches any of the characters a, b, or c.
[a-z]	Matches any lowercase letter.
Tips
Always escape special characters (e.g., \ becomes \\ in Java strings).
Use Pattern.compile() for reusable patterns to improve performance.
Test your regex patterns using online tools like regex101.
Regex is a powerful tool for text processing, and mastering it can greatly enhance your Java programming skills!


example:

package Regex;

import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class RegexEx1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("[XYZ]");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("y"); 

        System.out.println(matcher.matches());
    }
}
